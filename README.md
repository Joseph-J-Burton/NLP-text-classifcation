# NLP-text-classification

Project is from the Udemy course: 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass

## Purpose of Project
This is a project that uses some of the skills learned up to this point in the course and adding NLP to the list.
The project analyzes a data set from: ai.stanford.edu movie reviews.  
The project goes through the process of cleaning and organizing the data. Exploring the data, finding blank entries.
Using a portion of the data to train some classification models. Checking the performance of the models.
Uses a pipeline to transform the data and run the model.
The end goal is to have the model able to read a new text review and give it a label of positive or negative.

## Program version
- Python version 3.9.12
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8
- Visual Studio version 1.73.1

## Skills
- Read in data using pandas.  
- Explore data set using pandas.  
- Perform some analysis on the data using numpy.  
- Uses a vectorizer to transform the text to a numerical representation.  
- Uses Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and Linear SVC models to evaluate the data.  
- Uses classification report and confusion matrix, metrics from scikit-learn, to evaluate model performance.  
- Setup a pipeline to transform and run data through the model.  

## Improvements
I need to go through the project and try adjusting other parameters to see if I can improve the efficiency of the model.
It may be good to reduce the lines by removing some redundancy of coding, e.g. looking at the data set after doing some filtering of the data frame. I may need to include more explanation of the code.

## Comments
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to organize data and use of the machine learning natural language processing methods.
I found the course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
